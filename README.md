## About 
This is my personal portfolio website where I share my journey of a computer science student.

## Technology Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Netlify
*Note*: This project reflects my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript at a beginner level, learned independenly without formal web development training.

## Learning Journey
This project represents my first dive into web development, where I:
- Taught myself HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript from online resources
- Learned through trial and error rather than formal instruction
- Focused on making something functional rather than following best practices
- Built this entirely during my university studies without taking web development courses

If you notice areas that could be improved or don't follow standard conventions, that's because I was learning as I went! This website is a snapshot of my self-taught web development skills **at that time**.
